        Hello, I'm ratwithaface. Welcome to my dinky ass website.
        In here, you little shits can find all my previous and current projects
        that barely even function! Or, perhaps, you can visit my socials. Not like any of you faggots care.

        I'm a pretty well versed Node.js developer, and I'd love to learn Python. But I fucking despise CSS.
        Web Development is cool and all but do you know how long it took me to get the CSS just right
        for this website? Are you fucking kidding me? It's a fucking mind-numbing, soul-crushing, piece of shit.
        It's like trying to solve a fucking puzzle while blindfolded while being fucked in the ass by a thousand
        angry hornets. And the idiot who created this shitshow? HÃ¥kon Wium Lie? How about you go fuck yourself for being
        a fat tub of lard full of shit. You goddamn waste of space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, everything else is swag. I love Node, and I'm good at it. I've been using it since
        fifth grade so I'd like to believe I'm kinda decent y'know. But, I still have lots to learn.

          I'm actually currently working on only a few projects, but its still better than nothing. MANY things in the backlog
          to be made though.

        <p class="heading">CUMSUM</p>
        <p>
          CUMSUM is a current project I am working on. It is so far just a backend API with a database and a simple
          web scraper. But, in the future, CUMSUM will be more than just an API. It will log all of your cum data and present
          it to you in a neat and tidy format.

          This project I'm working on with <a href="https://backslashg.xyz/">Slash</a>, and it's basically a Discord userbot that
          allows anyone in a group chat to manage it. It comes with cool features like pinning messages across multiple group chats,
          self destructing group chats and creating a new one, and more. Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/FTG2085/ftgbot">github.com/FTG2085/ftgbot</a>.
